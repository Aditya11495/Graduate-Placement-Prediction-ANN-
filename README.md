This project aims to predict whether a student will receive admission to a graduate program based on academic performance, demographic information, and other relevant features. An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is used to identify patterns that influence graduate admission decisions.

The project covers the complete machine learning pipeline, including data preprocessing, feature scaling, model building, training, and evaluation. It demonstrates the practical application of deep learning techniques for a real-world binary classification problem in the education domain.
