This project aims to predict whether a graduate will be placed or not using academic, demographic, and skill-based features. An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is implemented to identify patterns influencing student placement outcomes.

The complete machine learning pipeline is covered, including data preprocessing, feature scaling, model building, training, and evaluation. This project demonstrates the practical application of deep learning techniques for a real-world binary classification problem in the education domain.
